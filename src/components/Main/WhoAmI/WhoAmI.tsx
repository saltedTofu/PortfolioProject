I began teaching myself to code in 2020 in order to create tools to make my RD job and life easier. While learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS, I fell in love with coding/web development and continuously find myself learning and implementing new technologies. Currently I find myself working a lot with React.js and Typescript.</p>
